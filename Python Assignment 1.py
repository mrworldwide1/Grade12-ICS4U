# Exercise 3.1
# The cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40 percent discount.
Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. Calculate the total
wholesale costs for 60 copies.

coverPrice = 24.95
bookStoreCoverPrice = coverPrice * 0.60
firstCopyShipping = 3
additionalCopyShipping = 0.75
copies = 60

totalWholesaleCosts = (copies*bookStoreCoverPrice)+firstCopyShipping
